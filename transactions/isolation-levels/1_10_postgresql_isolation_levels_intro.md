# Understanding PostgreSQL Transaction Isolation Levels

In PostgreSQL, like in many relational database management systems, transactions can be configured
to run at different isolation levels to control the visibility of uncommitted changes from one
transaction to another transaction. This ensures data consistency and integrity. The SQL standard
defines four isolation levels, and PostgreSQL supports all of them:

1. `Read Uncommitted`: This is the lowest level of isolation. In this level, a transaction may read
   uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This isolation level is generally not recommended
   because it can read "dirty" data that could be rolled back by the transaction that made the
   changes. PostgreSQL treats `READ UNCOMMITTED` the same as `READ COMMITTED` since it does not
   provide
   true `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation.
2. `Read Committed`: This is the default isolation level in PostgreSQL. In this level, a transaction
   can only see data that has been committed before the transaction began. However, within the same
   transaction, different queries can see different states of the database as other transactions
   commit.
3. `Repeatable Read`: In this isolation level, the data read by a transaction will remain the same
   over the course of the transaction. Other transactions may still insert new rows that match the
   WHERE clauses of the queries, but existing rows will appear the same.
4. `Serializable`: This is the strictest isolation level. It ensures complete isolation from other
   transactions, meaning the results of a transaction are not visible to other transactions until
   the transaction is committed. Serializable transactions in PostgreSQL are implemented using
   Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI), which is different from traditional two-phase locking.

You can set the transaction isolation level in PostgreSQL with the `SET TRANSACTION` statement, like so:
```sql
-- Setting the isolation level for a transaction
BEGIN;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
-- Your SQL queries here
COMMIT;
```
<br>
Or you can set it at the beginning of the transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
-- Your SQL queries here
COMMIT;
```
<br>
Understanding isolation levels is important for managing concurrency, performance, and data integrity. Each level has its trade-offs:

* Lower isolation levels like Read Committed are generally faster and allow for higher concurrency but at the cost of less strict data consistency.
* Higher isolation levels like Serializable provide the most strict data consistency but can be slower and less concurrent due to the increased locking.

Choose an isolation level based on your specific needs for data integrity, performance, and concurrency.
