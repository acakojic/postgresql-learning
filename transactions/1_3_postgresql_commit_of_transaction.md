# Understanding PostgreSQL Transaction Commit and Client Interactions

In a PostgreSQL database, transactions are crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.
One of the essential commands in a transaction is `COMMIT`, which is used to finalize all the
changes made during that transaction. When you issue a `COMMIT`, these changes become permanent and
are visible to other transactions.

#### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

* The database acquires the necessary locks to ensure data integrity.
* After a `COMMIT`, these locks are released.
* Other transactions waiting for these locks are allowed to proceed.

## Scenarios Involving Multiple Clients

Let's examine how different scenarios unfold when two clients want access to the same data.

### Scenario 1: Read-Only Access

Both clients can read the data at the same time without any conflicts.

##### Client A and B SQL Example:
```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'some_value';
COMMIT;
```

### Scenario 2: One Client Reads, Another Writes
Here, one client reads data while another modifies it.
The reading client will see the new data only if it queries after the writing client has committed the changes.

##### Client A SQL Example:
```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'some_value';
COMMIT;
```

##### Client B SQL Example:
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'new_value' WHERE column_name = 'some_value';
COMMIT;
```

### Scenario 3: Both Clients Write
In this case, if Client A starts modifying a row but doesn't commit immediately, 
Client B will be blocked until Client A either commits or rolls back.

##### Client A SQL Example:
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'new_value_A' WHERE column_name = 'some_value';
-- (Does not commit yet)
```

##### Client B SQL Example:
```sql
BEGIN;
-- Waits until Client A commits or rolls back
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'new_value_B' WHERE column_name = 'some_value';
COMMIT;
```

##### Client A SQL Example Continued:
```sql
-- Finally commits
COMMIT;
```

## Conclusion
The `COMMIT` operation in PostgreSQL ensures that all data modifications made during a transaction become permanent, thereby maintaining data integrity. 
Multiple clients can interact with the same data based on the transaction's isolation level and whether they are reading or writing data. 
This controlled interaction allows for a robust, multi-user database environment.
